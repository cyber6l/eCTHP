                                      << 4.3 Hunting Hypothesis and Methodology >>

This threat hunting methodology involves a systematic 5-step process:

1- Pick a Tactic and Technique:

Choose a specific attack technique from MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1502 - Parent PID Spoofing).
Focus on "Privilege Escalation" as an example.

2-Identify Associated Procedure(s):

Explore ATT&CK for procedures related to the chosen technique.
Conduct additional research through reports and blogs for a comprehensive understanding.

3-Perform an Attack Simulation:

Replicate the chosen technique's procedures to observe data and logs.
Understand the exhibited behaviors for future detection capabilities.

4-Identify Evidence to Collect:

Investigate artifacts across various locations (disk, in-memory, network, registry).
Look for deviations, abnormal occurrences, and unexpected encryption.

5-Set Scope:

Define the hunt scope, specifying duration and data sources.
Consider external factors, limitations, and assumptions guiding future decisions.

                                                    << 4.4 Hunting Metrics >>

Hunting metrics serve to measure and report progress during threat hunting. 
Key considerations include:

Meaningful Metrics:

Metrics go beyond finding malicious activity to gauge the effectiveness of the hunting process.
Avoiding Production Simulations:

Caution against simulating malicious activity in live environments.
Proposes coordination with penetration testing teams for safe detection capability testing.
Controlled Metrics for Showcase:

Metrics under hunter control demonstrate work effectively.
Examples include hunt frequency, ATT&CK technique coverage, relevant procedure coverage, network hunting, and historical logging capability.
The focus is on proactive and controlled metrics, acknowledging that finding malicious activity may not always be possible in real-world scenarios.
