                                      << 4.3 Hunting Hypothesis and Methodology >>

This threat hunting methodology involves a systematic 5-step process:

1- Pick a Tactic and Technique:

Choose a specific attack technique from MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1502 - Parent PID Spoofing)
Focus on "Privilege Escalation" as an example

2-Identify Associated Procedure(s):

Explore ATT&CK for procedures related to the chosen technique
Conduct additional research through reports and blogs for a comprehensive understanding

3-Perform an Attack Simulation:

Replicate the chosen technique's procedures to observe data and logs
Understand the exhibited behaviors for future detection capabilities

4-Identify Evidence to Collect:

Investigate artifacts across various locations (disk, in-memory, network, registry)
Look for deviations, abnormal occurrences, and unexpected encryption

5-Set Scope:

Define the hunt scope, specifying duration and data sources
Consider external factors, limitations, and assumptions guiding future decisions

                                                    << 4.4 Hunting Metrics >>

Hunting metrics serve to measure and report progress during threat hunting
Key considerations include:

Meaningful Metrics:

Metrics go beyond finding malicious activity to gauge the effectiveness of the hunting process
Avoiding Production Simulations:

Caution against simulating malicious activity in live environments
Proposes coordination with penetration testing teams for safe detection capability testing
Controlled Metrics for Showcase:

Metrics under hunter control demonstrate work effectively
Examples include hunt frequency, ATT&CK technique coverage, relevant procedure coverage, network hunting, and historical logging capability
The focus is on proactive and controlled metrics, acknowledging that finding malicious activity may not always be possible in real-world scenarios

بالبدايه لازم توضح لك ان
Introduces threat hunting without CTI reliance
Analysis a top-down approach and mentions CTI, network analysis, and endpoints
Team Dynamics وش :

Discusses team structures, assuming separate IT Security and Network teams

وش دور الثرت هانتق طيب:

هو Describes the role within the IT Security Team based on organization size

Network Hunting Scenario:

Outlines a scenario with the Network Team alerting a threat hunter

Process Steps:

Highlights steps: capturing packets and analyzing for threat confirmation

Detection Methods:

Explains how the Network Team identifies suspicious activity through alerts and analysis

Tools and Technologies:

Hints at tools for packet logging and briefly mentions networking basics
بالنهايه كل الكلام ذا مهم عشان تلحق التهديد ورا الشبكه 


                        << 1.2 TCP/IP & Networking Primer >>
Why It Matters!!!!

Understand TCP/IP stack for spotting anomalies
Know normal network communication, like a forgotten workstation's weekend FTP session

Hunter's Know-How:
Threat Hunter needs expertise in TCP/IP, port numbers, and app behavior on the network

Packets & Structure:
Data travels as packets with headers and payloads
Knowledge helps hunters analyze captures efficiently

OSI & TCP/IP Models:
Layers in both models. Protocols operate at different levels

Encapsulation Magic:
Protocols add headers during encapsulation. Reversed at the destination

IP Protocol & Routers:
IP delivers datagrams; routers forward them based on routing protocols

Routing & Switching:
Routing protocols determine paths; switches work with MAC addresses

ARP & Communication:
ARP request and reply process for IP address to MAC address mapping

TCP Handshake:
3-way handshake for TCP connections 
The header fields involved in 
the handshake are:
• Sequence number
• Acknowledgment number
• SYN and ACK flags

UDP Directed connected
