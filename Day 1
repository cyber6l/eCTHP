                                                  * Introduction to Threat Hunting *

                                                        << 1.1 Introduction >>

What is Threat Hunting : Threat hunting is the human-centric process of proactively
searching data and discovering cyber threats.

The hunter : attempts to locate and confirm abnormal activity

Threat Intelligence : involves the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about current and potential threats to an organization's digital security
It is used to inform proactive measures, improve defensive strategies
and support real-time decision-making to protect systems and data from cyber threats and compromises.

reactive vs proactively

reactive : Real-time monitoring like SOC 
proactively : After Real-time monitoring such as Threat hunting


                                                      << Incident Response >>


Incident Response: اي شي مخالف لسياسه الشركه و يؤدي الى threat

Incident Response Process: 1- Preparation 2 -detection and analysis 3 -Recovery  4 -Post-Incident Activity      
                                |-----------------------repetition---------------------------|

Preparation: This phase involves setting up the necessary tools, documentation, and responsibilities to handle incidents effectively. It also includes measures to reduce the likelihood of incidents.

Detection and Analysis: During this phase, the IR team verifies if a security breach has occurred by analyzing reported symptoms and classifying the situation as an incident if necessary.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: In this phase, the team gathers intelligence and creates signatures to identify compromised systems. 
They then implement countermeasures to neutralize the threat and work to restore systems and data to normal operation.

Post-Incident Activity: This phase involves learning from the incident to enhance the organization’s security posture and prevent future occurrences.

                                                        << Risk Assessments >>

What is a risk assessment : Risk assessments provide hunters with insights into the systems or processes most likely to be targeted by intruders.
Hunters need to think like attackers to identify critical targets within a network.

                                                      << Type Threat Hunting >>
1-Ad-hoc Hunter:
Multi-role, infrequent hunts.
Found in organizations without formal security teams.

2-Analyst and Hunter:
SOC analysts who also hunt.
Common in small organizations.

3-Dedicated Hunting Team:

Specialized team focused on hunting.
Typical in large or governmental organizations.

                                                  << 2.1 Threat Hunting Terms >>

 APTs : APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats, refer to organized groups or nation-states equipped with 
 substantial resources and sophisticated infrastructure, enabling them to engage in prolonged and targeted 
 malicious activities with a high degree of expertise and persistence.

 What is TTP ?

 Tactics : encompass the deliberate organization and use of forces to achieve a specific goal,
 representing the strategic rationale behind a chosen course of action.

 Techniques : هي الطرق أو الأساليب غير التوجيهية المستخدمة لأداء المهام أو الوظائف أو المهام

 Procedures : هي سلسلة محددة وقياسية من الإجراءات توفر دليلًا مفصلاً وموحدًا حول كيفية تنفيذ مهام

 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): are traces or artifacts extracted from either a current intrusion or a past security breach


 For example ->> GETMAIL: Malware for extracting emails and attachments from Outlook PST files.

                 MAPIGET: Malware targeting the extraction of emails and attachments from Exchange 
                          servers

                                       ----------------------------
Hash Values : A fixed-length numeric value serving as a unique identifier for data, used as a signature, such as {92dae8b89a9e366b88f57a11768ea}
IP addresse : An IP address is a numerical label assigned to devices on a network, used for identification and communication.
Domain names : aided by Dynamic DNS providers with APIs, are easily changeable web addresses.
Network/Host artifacts:  are traces left by adversaries in network packets or on endpoint systems, serving as clues for investigation.
Tools : its Tool ur USING LOL

The Cyber Kill Chain: outlines the stages of a cyber attack.
In both realms, it denotes the step-by-step progression of an offensive operation.

1- Recon: Gathering information on the target.
2- Weaponize: Developing and preparing the attack.
3- Deliver: Transporting the malicious payload to the target.
4- Exploit: Taking advantage of vulnerabilities to infiltrate.
5- Install: Implanting the malware on the target system.
5- C&C (Command & Control): Establishing control over the compromised system.
6- Action: Executing the intended malicious activities on the target.

                                                  

                                                << 2.2 Threat Hunting Mindset >>

What is threat intelligence? relevant information about potential cyber threats, 
aiding organizations in understanding and addressing security risks promptly.

Threat Intelligence can be divided into 3 types:
1. Strategic: Who, Why, and Where
2. Tactical: What and When
3. Operational: How
