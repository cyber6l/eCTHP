Preparation: This phase involves setting up the necessary tools, documentation, and responsibilities to handle incidents effectively. It also includes measures to reduce the likelihood of incidents.

Detection and Analysis: During this phase, the IR team verifies if a security breach has occurred by analyzing reported symptoms and classifying the situation as an incident if necessary.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: In this phase, the team gathers intelligence and creates signatures to identify compromised systems. 
They then implement countermeasures to neutralize the threat and work to restore systems and data to normal operation.

Post-Incident Activity: This phase involves learning from the incident to enhance the organization’s security posture and prevent future occurrences.
